## Starknet
**Starknet** is one of the most promising technologies in the Web3 scene. It is a Permissionless Decentralized ZK-Rollup. Any developer can deploy any dApp, using smart contracts, and achieve unlimited scale.

## Tutorial
**Disclaimer**: I'm not an expert in Starknet or Cairo, and will use this repo to document my learning process. Anyway, I recommend a basic knowledge on Blockchain as I won't go deeper into that. Also this is not a Cairo tutorial, go to the cairo page to find an excellent tutorial.

I'm planning to do one of this points everyday and I invite anyone reading this to contribute to this tutorial :)

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to cerate an NFT collections and connect it with ArgentX.
