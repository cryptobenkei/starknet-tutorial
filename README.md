## Tutorial
**Disclaimer**: I'm not an expert in Starknet or Cairo, and will use this repo to document my learning process. Anyway, I recommend a basic knowledge on Blockchain as I won't go deeper into that. Also this is not a Cairo tutorial, go to the cairo page to find an excellent tutorial.

I'm planning to do one of this points everyday and I invite anyone reading this to contribute to this tutorial :)

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to cerate an NFT collections and connect it with ArgentX.
