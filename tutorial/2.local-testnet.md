## Testnet
A Flask wrapper of Starknet state. Similar in purpose to Ganache.

Aims to mimic Starknet's Alpha testnet, but with simplified functionality.
```python
pip install starknet-devnet
```

E.g. if you want to use your host machine's 127.0.0.1:5000, you need to run:

docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 shardlabs/starknet-devnet

I let nile do the job:
```bash
nile node
```
