# Setting Up the environment
StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum, where any dApp can achieve unlimited scale for its computation, without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.

Cairo is a programming language for writing provable programs, where one party can prove to another that a certain computation was executed correctly. Cairo and similar proof systems can be used to provide scalability to blockchains.

I'm using Ubuntu and Python3.7 installed in my machine

## Step 1 : Install
It is recommened to work inside a Virtual Env.
```bash
python3.7 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies and Cairo

```bash
# sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
# pip3 install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
# wget https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/download/v0.7.0/cairo-lang-0.7.0.zip
# pip3 install ./cairo-lang-0.7.0.zip
```

## Step 2 : Compile a Cairo program

Open test.cairo
```cairo
func main():
    [ap] = 1000; ap++
    [ap] = 2000; ap++
    [ap] = [ap - 2] + [ap - 1]; ap++
    ret
end
```

**ap** is the allocation pointer and points to the next unused memory cell. 
1. We write 1000 to the first free cell and then we move to the next cell (app++).
2. We write 2000 to the second free cell and then we move to the next cell (app++).
3. We write 3000 (value at allocation pointer - 2 = 1000, value at allocation pointer -1 = 2000) to the third cell and then we move to the next cell (app++).

Compile it.
```
# cairo-compile test.cairo --output test_compiled.json
````

## Step 3 : Run
Now run.
```
# cairo-run --program=test_compiled.json --print_output --print_info --relocate_prints

7     12
8     12
9     1000
10    2000
11    3000

Number of steps: 4 (originally, 4)
Used memory cells: 11
Register values after execution:
pc = 12
ap = 12
fp = 12
```

The first cells corresponid to the code, and then we are writing to ap 9,10 and 11.

To keep in mind:
- **ap** is the allocation pointer
- **fp** is the frame pointer (value of ap at the beginning of the function.
- **pc** is the program counter.
