# Deploy and account

You can get a good example of an account [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/)

For our tutorial we will use the modified version by [Play Oasis](https://github.com/playoasis/cairo-contracts)

In another directory install the contracts:wq

```bash
# cd ..
# git clone https://github.com/playoasis/cairo-contracts
# cp -r cairo-contracts/openzeppelin starknet_nfts/contracts
# cd starknet_nfts
# nile compile
```

Install Starknet.js
```bash
# npm init
# npm install --save starknet
# mkdir scripts
# vi scripts/wallet.js
```

We are ready to go, we can install now an Account and a ERC20 to play with

```bash
# nile deploy Account 0x03ce5...
```

The address is your public address controlling
